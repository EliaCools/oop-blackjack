# Title: OOP: Blackjack

## The goal

The goal of this exercise was to learn how object-oriented-programming works.

## The process
This concept was new for me, Thus I found it very overwhelming and confusing. 
It took a long time before I started to get a grasp on it.
Once I finally got over the steep learning curve, I found it satisfying.

## The result
It is really cool to see how these different classes can work together to provide a new isolated instance of an object.
